[[https://melpa.org/#/recall][https://melpa.org/packages/recall-badge.svg]]

Recall and rerun processes created by the likes of =eshell=,
=async-shell-command=, =compile= and =dired-do-async-shell-command=.

Use =recall-list= to see working directory, stdout, start time, end
time, exit code and vc revision for live and exited processes.

+ =recall-rerun= to rerun any process.
+ =recall-rerun-edit= to rerun process after editing shell command.
+ =recall-find-log= to open process output log file.
+ =recall-process-kill= to kill running process.
...

Joining the functionality of bash reverse-i-search with =proced= (for
subprocesses of Emacs).

Includes integration with =embark= and =consult=.

Enable global mode =recall-mode= to start processes monitoring.

* Configuration
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package recall
    :ensure t
    :bind
    ;; Note: This binding overrides default binding for `find-file-read-only'
    ("C-x C-r" . recall-list)
    ;; Or if minibuffer completion is your preferable interface
    ("C-x C-r" . recall-rerun)
    :custom
    ;; Consult completion based interface
    ;; (recall-completing-read-fn #'recall-consult-completing-read)
    ;; Enable process surveillance
    (recall-mode +1))
#+end_src

* Note
This package uses =add-advice= on =make-process= and friends to store
metadata.  This is core Emacs functionality, usage might have
unintended consequences.  Disable =recall-mode= at the first signs of
process spawning troubles.

Package is inspired by detached.el
